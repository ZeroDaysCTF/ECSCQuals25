# Licence to Thrill
One of the interns had 'too much' at the office party and sent a company wide email saying 'we're not worthy of a valid software licence from his code'. Mgmt would really like to clap back with a valid licence key for the reply all email. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is simple. Get the licence key.
